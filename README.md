copy git- files to folder in PATH, then you can use it as a git command:

usage : git gitlab [command]

   new [name]      create a new repository\s\s
   delete [name]   delete the repository\s\s
   list            list all the repositories on the GitLab server\s\s
   -h              show this help\s\s
